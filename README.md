# Optimization for Machine Learning Programming Assignment 2

In this assignment you will be training an image classification and a
language modeling network using different optimization algorithms. The problem set is designed to
completed using [google colab](colab.research.google.com/) in order to make use of the free GPU resources provided by Google.

However, if you have access to a GPU in some other manner, you are certainly welcome to use that instead.

If you use colab, make sure you go to runtime->change runtime type, and select "GPU" so that you are using the GPU.

The assignment is due on April 6th.
