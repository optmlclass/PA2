# Optimization for Machine Learning Programming Assignment 2

In this assignment you will be training an image classification and a
language modeling network using different optimization algorithms. The problem set is designed to
completed using [google colab](colab.research.google.com/) in order to make use of the free GPU resources provided by Google.

However, if you have access to a GPU in some other manner, you are certainly welcome to use that instead.

To get started in colab, first download the `EC500_Spring2022_ProgrammingSet2.ipynb` file from this repo. Then, in colab, go to file->open notebook, choose the "upload" option and upload the downloaded file. 

If you use colab, make sure you go to runtime->change runtime type, and select "GPU" so that you are using the GPU.

The assignment is due on April 6th.

You should not need to modify any of the python files in this repo - they just provide modeling code and a few utility functions. The entire assignment is in the .ipynb file.
