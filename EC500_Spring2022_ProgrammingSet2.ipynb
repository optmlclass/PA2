        "\n",
        "1. WHat are these \"`p`\" values representing?\n",
        "\n",
        "In class, we frequently consider a single parameter $w$ to describe the model we are training, so that $w$ would represent all the weights in a neural network for example. However, in practice usually models are specified in a more modular manner. For example, we could have a linear model with a bias as:\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\hat y = \\langle A, x\\rangle + B\n",
        "$$\n",
        "where $A\\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is a weight vector and $B\\in\\mathbb{R}$ is a bias. For theoretical analyses, we might consider this model as parametrized by a single vector $w\\in \\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$, but when programming it is far simpler to have separate variables for $A$ and $B$. Just as in your previous programming assignment, the `A.grad` and `B.grad` variables will then be populated with  the partial derivatives of the overall loss with respect to $A$ and $B$. Thus, to implement a gradient based optimizer, we need to loop over all variables that were involved in specifying the model. `p` is the variable used to step through this loop, so in the linear model with bias example, `p` would take on both `A` and `B` as values.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What does `@torch.no_grad` do? \n",
        "\n",
        "This tells the pytorch not to record gradient operations for anything that happens inside the function, so it will not be able to compute derivatives of these operations. However, this is important to enable because some operations (like performing an update) inherently should not be differentiated, and pytorch will thrown an error if you do not explicitly tell it that you do not want to differentiate through this operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Why do we need `torch.enable_grad` when using the closure?\n",
        "\n",
        "Computing the closure (closure is essentially a fancy name for \"function\") is an alternative to providing the gradient to the optimization step. Instead, the loss $\\ell(w_t, z_t)$ is computed by the closure. However, the closure might need to compute some derivatives, so we turn on `torch.enable_grad`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Why do we use `p.add_` as opposed to `p = p - lr*grad`?\n",
        "\n",
        "All pytorch variables (and all python variables except for simple things like integers and chars for that matter) are essentially *pointers*. That is, `p` is a name for an area of computer memory that contains the data for some vector. This makes it fast to pass `p` around to various functions, but if we do `p = z`, this actually means that now `p` refers to the same memory location that `z` is referring to. This is a problem, because the original data has not been changed. `p.add_` instead will change the original data. If you are not familiar with this concept in programming, you may want to do some reading on pass-by-reference vs pass-by-value and pointers.\n",
